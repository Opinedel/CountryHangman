        <h1>How To Play</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>You have to guess a random mystery country.</li>
            <li>The number of blanks(_) at the top signify the number of letters in the name of the country.</li>
            <li>If the name of the country has more than one word, then the words are sperated by a '/', even if they have a hyphen(-) in the original name.</li>
            <li>You have to click on a letter from the ones shown on screen, if you feel that letter is in the answer.</li>
            <li>If the letter you chose is indeed in the answer, the blanks will change to show you the position of the letter you picked in the answer</li>
            <li>In case the letter you picked is not in the answer, the picture of the hangman will gain a body part.</li>
            <li>Once the picture is completed with the entire body of the man visible, which will be after 7 inaccuracies, then the man is 'hanged', and you lose.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Important: Keep in Mind</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All the 193 UN member countries + <b>Taiwan</b>, <b>PALESTINE</b> and <b>VATICAN CITY</b> are included.</li>
            <li>The <b>ENGLISH</b> name for all the countries has been used. Eg - Türkiye is written as <b>TURKEY</b>, Côte d'Ivoire is written as <b>IVORY COAST</b>, Cabo Verde is written as <b>CAPE VERDE</b>, and Timor-Leste is written as <b>EAST TIMOR</b>. Any accent marks or symbols atop letters that are not in English are excluded.</li>
            <li>The most used names of the countries are used, not the full name. Eg - United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is written as <b>UNITED KINGDOM</b>. </li>
            <li>There is no <b>'THE'</b> at the beginning of country names, but they can be somewehere in there.</li>
            <li>Country abbreviations are not used. It is not USA, it is <b>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</b>. </li>
            <li>Since there are two Congos, the official names of both have been used: <b>REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO</b> and <b>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO</b>.</li>
            <li>The two Koreas are written as <b>NORTH KOREA</b> and <b>SOUTH KOREA</b>.</li>
            <li>In countries having more than one word, two words are seperated by a '/', even if they have a hyphen(-) in the original name.</li>
        </ul>
